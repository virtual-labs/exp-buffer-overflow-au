      "question": "What is a buffer overflow?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A type of memory corruption where data exceeds allocated space.",

        "d": "A technique for encrypting data."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Buffer overflow occurs when data exceeds the allocated memory space, potentially leading to crashes or vulnerabilities.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Buffer overflow is not about memory optimization.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Buffer overflow is unrelated to debugging.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Buffer overflow is not related to encryption."

      "question": "Which of the following is a common consequence of a buffer overflow?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Memory leakage",
        "b": "Execution of arbitrary code",
        "c": "Data compression",
        "d": "Improved performance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Buffer overflow usually does not directly cause memory leakage.",
        "b": "Buffer overflow can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, which can be exploited by attackers.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Data compression is not a result of buffer overflow.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Buffer overflow typically decreases performance or causes system crashes."

    {
      "question": "How can a buffer overflow vulnerability be prevented?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By using safe functions like strncpy() instead of strcpy()",
        "b": "By increasing buffer sizes",
        "c": "By using faster processors",
        "d": "By disabling memory protection"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Using safer functions like strncpy() helps prevent buffer overflow by limiting the number of characters copied.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Simply increasing buffer sizes does not eliminate the risk of overflow.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Processor speed does not affect buffer overflow vulnerabilities.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Disabling memory protection would make the system more vulnerable to attacks."
